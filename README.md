# HackintoshPrebuiltEFI

Hi, this is a EFI, built myself of course, and decided to release this on Github.
I would like to see if anything happens, i'll check out the Issues tab.

# Specs:

CPU: Intel Core i5-7500
dGPU: NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti (unused)
iGPU: Intel HD 630 Graphics (used)
Ethernet Cable (Realtek RTL8192CE Wireless LAN 802.11n PCI-E NIC)
Corsair Vengeance 2x8GB 2400mHz
Samsung 860 Evo SATA
MSI B250M PRO-VD

This EFI works for me to boot into Windows and macOS.
Thank you for reading me!
